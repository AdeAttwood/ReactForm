# React Form - Overview

React Form is a UI agnostic form abstraction for React. It was built out of the
frustration of having to manage attribute and error state using `useState`. It
is built to be a low level form library, so you can build your own form inputs
that integrate with your design system. This makes building forms with React
look consistent and promotes roper abstraction of application logic.

Form inputs can be built using render a prop that receive `props` and `error`.
The props can be spread on to an input, giving you full access to the native
elements for full customizability.

```jsx
import { InputGroup } from "@adeattwood/react-form";

const Input = ({ attribute, label }) => (
  <InputGroup attribute={attribute}>
    {({ props, error }) => (
      <div>
        <label htmlFor={props.id}>{label}</label>
        <input {...props} />
        {error && <p>{error}</p>}
      </div>
    )}
  </InputGroup>
);
```

Then to use your input you can wrap then in the `Form` component that will use
a context to manage all of the for logic for you. Once the form is submitted
the `onSubmit` function will be called with the current state of the form.

```jsx
import { Form } from "@adeattwood/react-form";

<Form
  initialValues={{ username: "" }}
  onSubmit={({ formState }) => console.log(formState.username)}
>
  <Input label="Username" attribute="username"
  <button>Submit</button>
</Form>
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
