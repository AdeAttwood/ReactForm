# Form Component

The `Form` component is the wrapper for all the inputs and is where the context
for your form is held. The only required props for the component are
`initialValues` that is the initial value for the form state and a `onSubmit`
callback that will be called when the user submits a valid form.

```jsx
import { Form } from "@adeattwood/react-form"

<Form
  initialValues={{ firstname: "", lastname: "" }}
  onSubmit={({ formState }) => api.createUser(formState)}
>
  <FirstNameInput />
  <LastNameInput />
</Form>
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
